Brainfuck organisms function as coding blocks cpus.
The way they interact with the enviroment is by writing to their memory tape and executing commands based on the number present at cetain points.
An organism has multiple rows of code strings. Each row has its own cursor so each row also manipulates the same tape.

Some points on the tape are representation of the enviroment. such as what the organism is facing is a certain number. how many blocks away is the item its looking at.
whats the current energy state of the organism.

the current commands the organism can execute on its self and its enviroment is push, attack, pull, move L R F B, turn L or R. Breed, mitosis, self mutate. it also has the ability to self edit code.
